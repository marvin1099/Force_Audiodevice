# Force Default Audiodevice
This AutoHotkey script will write a custom powershell script, 
which will change your default playback or/and recording audio device to the one you want

# IMPORTANT
When it ask you for a ***ID*** for the playback or recording default device,  
just copy the id field from the the wanted audio device out of the powershell window that opens

When it ask you for a ***NAME*** for the playback or recording communication device,  
only copy the name ***BEFORE*** the brackets out of the powershell window that opens

After you dont need The powershell Audiolist anymore just close it off
